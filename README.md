# VisualQRCP

A Julia function to compute a column-pivoted QR factorization (QRCP) using the algorithm of Businger and Golub (1965), displaying each step of the factorization so that the algorithm can be visualized. See Pete Businger and Gene H. Golub, *Linear Least Squares Solutions by Householder Transformations*, Numerische Mathematik, 7 (1965).
